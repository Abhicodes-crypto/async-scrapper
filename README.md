# Async Scrapper Python


Here is an example to asynchronously scrape data from the website https://cafa.iphiview.com/ .

7000 api calls are made, their responses are scraped and written to a csv file  
within 24 mins.

A normal sequential single threaded program estimated to take 6 hrs for the same.

Would aim to parallelize and reduce this even more.
